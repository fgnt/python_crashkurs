# Python Introduction Course

The goal of this Python Introduction Course is to teach the fundamental tools and functions of Python that are neccessary during several courses of the communications engineering group or the measurement engineering group (VSS, KSS, SML, OAF, ..., ), but are also applicable in a broader spectrum of lectures.

This Introduction course consists of three parts with an extent of 2h each:

 - Setting up Python (Laptop/ university computer pool), Python fundamentals, Jupyter
 - Numerical Python (numpy, scipy)
 - Evaluation and visualization (pandas, matplotlib, ...)

<!-- While the course was originally designed for multiple presence sessions, this time the course is intended as an online tutorial. 
However, there will be a question round at April 15st 09:00 to solve eventual problems with the setup of the Python environment. -->
The course will take place on October 29th, 2021 and the following Friday from 14:00 to 16:00 in the pool room P7.2.02.1.
This year, we will skip the third part.
The participation in this course is fully optional.
Nevertheless, the practical exercises in the courses mentioned above require the content of this introduction course and will not repeat its content.

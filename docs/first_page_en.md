# Python Introduction Course

The goal of this Python Introduction Course is to teach the fundamental tools and functions of Python that are
necessary during several courses of the communications engineering group
<!-- or the measurement engineering group -->
(VSS, SML, TPRML, OAF, ZDSV, NT, <!--KSS, -->..., ), but are also applicable in a broader spectrum of lectures.

This Introduction course consists of three parts with an extent of 2h each:

 - Setting up Python (Laptop/ university computer pool), Python fundamentals, Jupyter (date one)
 - Numerical Python (numpy, scipy)
   - Numpy introduction and exercise (date two)
   - How to: Translate math do code (date three)
<!--  - Evaluation and visualization (pandas, matplotlib, ...) -->

<!-- While the course was originally designed for multiple presence sessions, this time the course is
intended as an online tutorial. 
However, there will be a question round at April 15st 09:00 to solve eventual problems with the setup
of the Python environment. -->
<!-- The course will take place on October 21th, 2022 and the following Friday from 14:00 to 16:00
in the pool room P7.2.02.1. -->
<!-- The course will start on Friday, October 11th at 13:30 with part one in poolroom P7.2.02.1.
The other parts will be on the following Fridays (October 18, October 25) at the same time. -->
<!-- The two dates for the second part will be decided in our first meeting. -->
<!-- This year, we will skip the third part (pandas, ...). -->
The participation in this course is fully optional.
Nevertheless, the practical exercises in the courses mentioned above require the content of this introduction
course and will not repeat its content.
